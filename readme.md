## Commentary

``` {.sourceCode .lisp}
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a hack to refresh git-gutter+ in open
;; project-buffers after an interactive commit via magit.
;;
;; This behavior appears to have been supported by git-gutter+ at some
;; time, but the project has not seen active development in some time and it is possible
;; that a more-recent version of magit broke this functionality.
;;
;; As such, this code does not belong here but rather pushed upstream.
;; It is my intent to push this code upstream after some additional
;; optimizations are derived for performance.
;;
;; Thanks for your understanding, patience and help making it so!
